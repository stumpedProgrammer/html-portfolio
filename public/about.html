<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Murali Krishna Reddy Dodda, a computer science student currently enrolled at Stockton Universtiy. The world of programming excites me â€“ I love the challenge of taking an idea and transforming it into a functioning piece of software.</p>

<p>That's why I'm building this portfolio website. It's a chance for me to showcase the projects I've been working on, the problems I've tackled, and the skills I've developed along the way.  This website is more than just a collection of code; it's a window into my journey as a programmer.</p>

<p>As I continue to learn and grow, this site will evolve with me. It'll be a dynamic space where I can share my latest creations and demonstrate my expanding knowledge. Consider this your invitation to explore the mind of a budding computer scientist!</p>
